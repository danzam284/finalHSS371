        <h1>The Digital Divide in Education</h1>
        <div id="text1" class="text">
            According to Microsoft, "Just 1% of primary state schools provide devices that their pupils can take home, compared to 38% of private primary schools". As society continues
            to progress digitally, education has become heavily reliant on the use of technology. However, not all students have access to these tools, creating a divide within schools 
            and communities. This gap can have vast effects on both academic performance as well as future opportunities. I made this website to inform about this digital divide and 
            some ways that it can be bridged in order to restore equality of opportunity between all students.
